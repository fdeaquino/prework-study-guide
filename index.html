        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and provides the STRUCTURE of a webpage</li>
          <li>Think of HTML as the frame of a house.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The title of a webpage is pretty important for Search Engine Optimization. SEO is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines like Google or Bing.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>All elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside the body element.</li>
          <li>Within the body section there are a lot of HTML elements. Look at notes on iPad for the break down. :)</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>The three ways to style a webpage using CSS are inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.</li>
          <li>Developers use inline CSS to style an element directly in the HTML file. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all taged page elements.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes change easier.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we have to link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>The CSS Box Model consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are making the entire element bigger!</li>
          <li>DRY code is a coding principle that encourages devs to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines in code that need to be written or maintailed. DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself and can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
