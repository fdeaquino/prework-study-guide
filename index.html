        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language and provides the STRUCTURE of a webpage</li>
          <li>Think of HTML as the frame of a house.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>Elements included within the head are not visible when a user looks at a webpage.</li>
          <li>The title of a webpage is pretty important for Search Engine Optimization. SEO is the process of improving the ranking of a website in search engines like Google or Bing.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>All elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside the body element.</li>
          <li>Within the body section there are a lot of HTML elements. Look at notes on iPad for the break down. :)</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>The three ways to style a webpage using CSS are inline CSS, internal CSS, and external CSS.</li>
          <li>Developers use inline CSS to style an element directly in the HTML file. They're useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>The internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. A single change to the CSS rule will apply to all taged page elements.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes change easier.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we have to link the file using a link element placed in the HTML's head.</li>
          <li>The CSS Box Model consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element. The margin property acts much like a margin in a word processing document.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element. When you increase padding, you are making the entire element bigger!</li>
          <li>DRY code is a coding principle that encourages devs to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines in code that need to be written or maintailed. DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself and can greatly reduce the overall size and complexity of a codebase.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git fetch: downloads all history from the remote tracking branches</li>
          <li>git merge: combines remote tracking branch into current local branch</li>
          <li>git push: uploads all local branch commits to GitHub</li>
          <li>git pull: updates your current local working branch with all new commits from the corresponding remote branch on Github</li>
          <li>git pull: is a combination of git fetch and git merge</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript handles logic and allows users to interact with a website.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript, code runs from the first statement at the top of the page, down to the last statement at the bottom of the page.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive, meaning myVariable is not the same as myvariable.</li>
          <li>A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text.</li>
          <li>Note that whereas the style.css file is linked within the Head element, the script.js file is linked within the Body element on the index.html file.</li>
          <li>An IF Statement is a way of introducing decision-making into our code. Code will only execute IF the statement meets a condition, or is true.</li>
          <li>A value is considered FALSY if it is one of the following values: 0, -0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN, or a Boolean data type with the value of False.</li>
          <li>All other values, including a Boolean with the value of True, are considered TRUTHY.</li>
          <li>A strict equality operator (===) checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result True if the values are equal and False if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is an ordered collection of data. Arrays are used to store multiple values (that are related in some way) in a single variable.</li>
          <li>An index (a unique number) is the location of the data item in the array. Arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. Indices will always be whole numbers that increase by 1 each time.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code makes the code inactive without deleting it, just in case it needs to be used later. /* and */ are placed before and after the block of code to Comment Out.</li>
          <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Functions are different from For Loops and Conditional Statements because functions don't automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run. Instead, you have to call a function by name in order to execute it.</li>
          <li>A function's name is follwed by parenthesis () and the syntax is similar to For Loops and If Statements. The code that needs to be executed is written inside curly brackets {}.</li>
