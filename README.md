# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is a brief collection of notes on HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript for the prework requisite for Rice University's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. While this project was a requisite for my coding bootcamp, I was motivated to complete it because it was my first real experience learning and writing code. I built this study guide to keep helpful notes, but also to gain direct and practical experience. If I forget about an important concept on one of these topics, I can always use this study guide as a reference.
